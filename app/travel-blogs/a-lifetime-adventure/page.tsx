        <p className="blog_paragraph">12<sup>th</sup> May 2024. The day started early as we began our journey to Bettada Rangaswami Betta, our main and initial destination. The destination was almost 100 km from Udupi. We quickly had a cup of tea ☕️ in Manipal to brush off our sleepy eyes and get ready for the stretch. Starting off, there were three of us: me, Akanksh, and Ganesh. Two other riders, Anirudh and Brahmananda, were to join us in Karkala. In no time, we reached Karkala and finished our breakfast there. It was a tiny hotel in Karkala that was open at 6 in the morning and served us a really good breakfast. OFF WE GO! 🏍️ Now that we all had our breakfast, we set our path to the destination.</p>

        <p className="blog_paragraph">
          As you can see in the pictures, the view along the way was very scenic, and the rising sun 🌅 added to that beautiful morning. We were having a great time. Perfect weather ☀️, good roads (well... mostly), and lush greenery 🌿 all added up to the perfect morning.
        </p>
        <p className="blog_paragraph">
          Since it was my first time traveling that route, I got to discover a few things. I've always heard of Dharmasthala Temple and the devotees from all over who visit Dharmasthala. Covering this route gave me a glimpse of the temple, although we didn't actually visit it. Charmadi Ghat is another thing I got to experience, not to mention all the Fulja soda stalls along the way.

        <h3 className="blog_section_heading">The Part we were waiting for</h3>
        <p className="blog_paragraph">
          At around 8:45 am, we almost reached the destination. The only part remaining was the final stretch of proper off-road! We were all excited 🤩. It was a pretty tough off-road (maybe because I'm a novice rider). There were steep inclines, rocky patches, and some really good views along the way. Every bit of this was worth it once we reached the top. Please watch the video shown below to see the complete off-road experience recorded from my friend's POV, who was riding an Xpulse 200 4v.

          The view at the top was simply awesome and really peaceful 🏞️. We all sat there for a while and just admired the view. Although we could not see the green mountains, since we went there in summer, the view from the top was still perfect.

        <p className="blog_paragraph">
          After having a good look at the view and spending some time, we rode down the hill and made a quick decision to visit a train tunnel nearby (which is prohibited, by the way 🚫). We spent some time there, and it was already noon, so we decided to have lunch 🍴.

        <p className="blog_paragraph">
          Our final destination was Kadumane Abbi Falls. After having our lunch, we set our direction to the falls, and then came the first mishap. Since I had just had lunch and did not take any rest, I was feeling really drowsy 😴 yet decided to continue riding (which was a bad decision). Out of nowhere, I fell asleep for a quick second, and the next thing I knew, my motorcycle was out of control, and it fell down. Thankfully, I jumped off, so I did not get hurt. However, due to the impact, the rear brake was bent and was not working anymore 🏍️.
        </p>
        <p className="blog_paragraph">
          We continued our journey to the falls and reached there. There was not much water, so we started to play in the water 🌊. And then came the second mishap. It rained cats and dogs 🌧️. We were literally freezing, the water level was rising, we were in the middle of the forest 🌳, and we were scared!

        <p className="blog_paragraph">
          If that wasn't enough, out of nowhere a big branch was about to fall on other visitors due to the wind, but thankfully one of my friends heard the branch cracking and warned them to move. They were all saved by a few seconds 🙏.
        </p>
        <p className="blog_paragraph">
          By now, we were all devastated. We had no raincoat to cover ourselves, the motorcycles were far away, and the five of us stood there under one raincoat until the rain lessened 🌂. The experience is unexplainable in words. It was definitely A LIFETIME ADVENTURE 🌟.
